AquaLink
Overview
AquaLink is a platform for monitoring coral reef health and ocean temperatures using smart buoys and satellite data. The system helps marine biologists and conservationists track reef bleaching events and climate impact on marine ecosystems.

How It Works
Smart Buoy Network
Temperature Sensors: Deploy smart buoys that continuously monitor sea surface temperatures

Data Transmission: Real-time data streaming from offshore buoys to cloud platforms

Coral Health Monitoring: Track bleaching events and reef conditions

Dashboard & Visualization
Live Data Feeds: Real-time temperature and weather data from buoy networks

Historical Analysis: Long-term trend visualization for climate research

Alert System: Notifications for temperature thresholds that trigger coral bleaching
